		<h2>Autumn</h2>

		<p><img alt="amazon" class="floatleft" src="images/autumn.jpg"></p>

		<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Autumn-Ali-Smith-ebook/dp/B01FEY5BOQ/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=Autumn&qid=1633012172&sr=8-5"
			title="Autumn book"> Buy at Amazon</a> <!-- This is the link for buying a book from the Amazon -->

		<p><strong>Author: </strong>Ali Smith</p>

		<p><strong>Description:</strong>

		<p>The first of four novels in a shape-shifting series, wide-ranging in timescale and light-footed through
			histories. Fusing Keatsian mists and mellow fruitfulness with the vitality, the immediacy and the colour-hit
			of Pop Art--via a bit of very contemporary skulduggery and skull-diggery-- Autumn is a witty excavation of
			the present by the past. The novel is a stripped-branches take on popular culture, and a meditation, in a
			world growing ever more bordered and exclusive, on what richness and worth are, what harvest means. Autumn
			is part of the quartet Seasonal: four stand-alone novels, separate yet interconnected and cyclical (as the
			seasons are), exploring what time is, how we experience it, and the recurring markers in the shapes our
			lives take and in our ways with narrative.</p>

			title="Educated book">Buy at Amazon</a>

		<p><strong>Author: </strong>Tara Westover</p>

		<p><strong>Description:</strong>

		<p>Tara Westover was seventeen when she first set foot in a classroom. Instead of traditional lessons, she grew
			up learning how to stew herbs into medicine, scavenging in the family scrap yard and helping her family
			prepare for the apocalypse. She had no birth certificate and no medical records and had never been enrolled
			in school.
			Westover’s mother proved a marvel at concocting folk remedies for many ailments. As Tara developed her own
			coping mechanisms, little by little, she started to realize that what her family was offering didn’t have to
			be her only education. Her first day of university was her first day in school—ever—and she would eventually
			win an esteemed fellowship from Cambridge and graduate with a PhD in intellectual history and political
			thought.</p>

			title="exit west book">Buy at Amazon</a>

		<p><strong>Author: </strong>Moshin Hamid</p> <!--Strong tag is use for the bold text -->

		<p><strong>Description:</strong>

		<p>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia
			and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature
			intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of
			checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away,
			if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a
			choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through. . . .
			Exit West follows these remarkable characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling
			to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and
			powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely
			of our time and for all time.</p>

		<p>Tom Hazard has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but because of a rare condition,
			he's been alive for centuries. From performing with Shakespeare, to exploring the high seas with Captain
			Cook, to sharing cocktails with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom has seen a lot. But now, after over 400 years of
			reinventing himself to escape detection, he just wants an ordinary life. The only rule he has to follow is
			Don’t fall in love.
			When Tom catches the eye of a captivating woman named Camille at the dog park, everything begins to unravel.
			Caught between the danger of discovery and the desire to build a real life, Tom learns that the thing he
			can't have might just be the thing that saves him.
			A wild, bittersweet, time-travelling story, How to Stop Time is about losing and finding yourself, about the
			certainty of change, about the perils of love and about the mistakes that humans are doomed to repeat. It
			asks the question, How many lifetimes does it take to learn how to live?</p>

			title="the last hours book">Buy at Amazon</a>

		<p><strong>Author:</strong>Minette Walters</p>

		<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

		<p>Widowed by her husband’s death from the pestilence, Lady Anne assumes control of his people’s future—200
			bonded serfs without rights of ownership to land. Strong, compassionate and resourceful—qualities she kept
			hidden from the husband she loathed and despised—Lady Anne chooses a bastard slave, Thaddeus Thurkell, to
			act as her steward. Together, they decide to quarantine Develish by bringing the serfs inside a defendable
			moat and sharing the available food amongst all. With this sudden overturning of the accepted social order,
			where serfs exist only to serve their lords, conflict arises when they’re given a voice. Ignorant of what is
			happening in the world outside, they wrestle with themselves, with God and the terrible uncertainty of their
			futures. They fear starvation when their food runs out but they fear the pestilence more. Who amongst them
			has the courage to leave the safety of the demesne in search of supplies and news? And how safe is anyone in
			Develish when an unexplained murder threatens the uneasy status quo?
			In The Last Hours Minette Walters brings all her trademark intelligence to a totally new timeframe—creating
			a vivid and powerful drama through compelling characters whose journey readers will be drawn to. The Last
			Hours is an exciting new direction from an established best-selling author and Minette is currently writing
			the sequel.</p>
